## Synopsis

The [JavaScript standard library][standard-library-proposal] UUID describes an API for generating
character encoded Universally Unique Identifiers (UUID) based on [IETF RFC 4122][rfc-4122],
available for import in JavaScript engines.

## Motivation

### UUID generation is an extremely common software requirement

The [`uuid` module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) on npm currently receives some
[64,000,000 monthly downloads](https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=uuid) and is relied on by
over 2,600,000 repositories (as of June 2019).

The ubiquitous nature of the `uuid` module demonstrates that UUID generation is a common
requirement for JavaScript software applications, making the functionality a good candidate for the
standard library.

### Developers "re-inventing the wheel" is potentially harmful

Developers who have not been exposed to RFC 4122 might naturally opt to invent their own approaches
to UUID generation, potentially using `Math.random()` (in [TIFU by using `Math.random()`][tifu]
there's an in-depth discussion of why a Cryptographically-Secure-Pseudo-Random-Number-Generator
(_CSPRNG_) should be used when generating UUIDs).

Introducing a UUID standard library, which dictates that a CSPRNG must be used, helps protect
developers from security pitfalls.

## Overview

The UUID standard library provides an API for generating RFC 4122 identifiers.

The default export of the UUID library is the
[Version 4 Algorithm](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122#section-4.4), and returns the string
representation _(as described in RFC-4122)_.

```js
import uuid from 'lib:uuid'; // (Note: exact import syntax is TBD).
uuid(); // 52e6953d-edbe-4953-be2e-65ed3836b2f0
```

## Out of scope

Algorithms described in RFC 4122 other than Version 4 are not initially supported.

Statistics we've collected ([see data/README.md](./data/README.md)) indicate that the Version 4
algorithm is most widely used:

| Algorithm Version | Repo Count | %     | Weighted by Watch Count | %     |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ----- | ----------------------- | ----- |
| v4                | 4315       | 77.0% | 149802                  | 89.5% |
| v1                | 1228       | 21.9% | 16219                   | 9.7%  |
| v5                | 51         | 0.9%  | 1290                    | 0.8%  |
| v3                | 11         | 0.2%  | 116                     | 0.1%  |

### Regarding other UUID versions

While there is utility in other UUID versions, we are advocating starting with a minimal API
surface that supports a large percentage of users _(the string representation of Version 4 UUIDs)._

If research and/or user feedback later indicates that additional functionality, such as versions 1,
3, and 5 UUIDs, would add value, this proposal does not preclude these additions.

## Use cases

How do folks in the community use RFC 4122 UUIDs?

### Creating unique keys for database entries

### Generating fake testing data

### Writing to temporary files

## FAQ

**what are the advantages to uuid being in the standard library?**

- The `uuid` module is relied on by `> 2,600,000` repos on GitHub (June 2019). Guaranteeing a
  secure, consistent, well-maintained UUID implementation provides value to millions of developers.
- The 12 kb `uuid` module is downloaded from npm `> 62,000,000` times a month (June 2019); making
  it available in the standard library eventually saves TBs of bandwidth globally. If we continue
  to address user needs, such as `uuid`, with the standard library, bandwidth savings add up.
